# ReadySetGrow

Have you ever found yourself asking why all the plants on your windowsill are turning yellow? Or have you ever left for a week-long trip only to find all your plants wilted and dead upon your return? Well, we certainly have. We’d like to believe it’s not our fault - there has got to be a more efficient and reliable way to care for your plants!

As experienced plant-killers, we understand the struggle of having good intentions but terribly forgetful habits. The solution was simple - to create an integrated Arduino and Android app system that helps you become a better gardener!

### How we built it
* Arduino (C++)
* Node.js (Javascript)
* AWS & DynamoDB
* Android Studio (Java, XML)
